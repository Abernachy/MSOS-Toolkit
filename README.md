# 15 March 2025 Update
This project was never completed.  I got permission from the Squadron Commander to work on this but never formally got permission from our Comm Squadron or any of our Cyber Folks.  I was directed to go poke around and see if we were even allowed to create our own organization's web site to help advertise to our potential customers, Army/Navy/Marines/etc, what the 621st Mobility Support Operations Squadron even does and how they can help them.

I got a response back a week later stating that if we wanted to make our own from scratch website we needed to get permission in an MFR format from a 2 star and the site itself needed to be vetted and approved for CUI.  Realizing that process in itself was going to take significant time, I privated the Toolkit repo and stopped all development of it.  We were directed to Milsuite, which was approved for CUI and was in use by our Joint Partners so I created a Milsuite suite for the unit, which I'll put a link below once I get images and do a write up of it since Milsuite will be sunset and taken offline at the end of the month.




# MSOS Electronic Toolkit
This project will be a NEXTJS style web application that will essentially be the MSOS version of Stepbrief ( https://stepbrief.net).  The intention is to give us a centralized place fo customer files and links for ourselves and AMLOs.  Once complete we'll look at deploying this to an Amazon EC2 instance with access to an S3 bucket (Big blue gave me a free class for this, it would be a good opportunity to use it.).  The project will be privated and held on my (Abernachy's) Github.  Additional collaborators can be added for future use as needed.


# Boiler Plate Readme Below  


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
